# Flip Horizontal

A simple Blender addon that lets you quickly flip a scene's active camera horizontally. This is really useful for artists to be able to see a composition from a new angle.

This addon takes into account the scale of your camera, so if you have for some reason scaled it up or down it will invert the x-axis but otherwise keep the scale the same.

## Hot Key

The default hotkey is Shift+F, but this can be rebound in preferences under 

Keymap -> 3D View -> 3D View (Global) -> Flip Active Camera Horizontally

## Installing
To install, simply select FlipHorizontal.py when installing a new addon.
